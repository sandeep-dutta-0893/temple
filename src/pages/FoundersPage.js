          <p class="p2">Meet our founder Guruji Sri Rama Shakti ji, a multifaceted individual whose life has been 
          dedicated to the pursuit of music, spirituality, and community service. Renowned as a distinguished musician and 
          Carnatic singer, he has carved a niche for himself in the world of classical arts. His melodious renditions have 
          resonated not only across the auditoriums but also within the hearts of those who appreciate the 
          intricacies of traditional Indian music.</p>
          <p class="p2">In addition to his musical prowess, he is a visionary who, alongside his spiritual endeavors, founded 
          the Shri Yoga Hanuman Temple, a sacred space that also venerates Balaji and Shiva. His establishment stands as a testament 
          to his commitment to fostering spiritual growth and preserving cultural heritage in the diverse landscape of Canada. 
          Having forsaken a flourishing career in the software industry, he redirected his energy and resources in 2010 towards the 
          creation of this charitable organization aimed at benefitting society at large.</p>
          <p class="p2">Rama Shakti Guruji's altruistic endeavors extend beyond the temple walls. His dedication to community 
          service reflects a deep-rooted belief in the transformative power of social responsibility. By devoting his full time 
          to the maintenance of the temple and engaging in philanthropic initiatives, he has become a beacon of inspiration for 
          those who seek to make a positive impact on society.</p>
          <p class="p2">Not only is the priest a musical virtuoso and spiritual leader, but he is also a scholarly luminary. 
          Armed with a doctorate in language and cultural studies, he once graced the halls of Presidency College as a professor, 
          where he imparted knowledge to the eager minds of the next generation. His intellectual pursuits are not confined to 
          academia, as evidenced by his stint at All India Radio, where he played a role in disseminating cultural knowledge to a 
          wider audience.</p>
          <p class="p2">In summary, the guruji emerges as a harmonious blend of musical excellence, spiritual devotion, and scholarly 
          wisdom. His journey from the software industry to the temple, from professorial duties to community service, paints a 
          portrait of an individual whose life is a symphony of selflessness, culture, and enlightenment.</p>
          <p class="p2">His message to the people is “Be aware of gods”!</p>
